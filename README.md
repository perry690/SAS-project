# SAS-project
# perform data screening and generate reports for data with problems

#Suppose you are doing an epidemiological observational study to find risk factors for
#heart attack. Data are collected from medical charts and saved as SAS data sets. These
#data usually contain numerous errors, such as typos, missing records, inconsistent
#measurement units, etc. It is important to clean the data prior to doing any analyses. Some
#of these errors, e.g., data entry errors, are correctable after communication with the study
#site or contacts with study subjects. Thus, data screening is an important step in the
#conduct of a study. Problematic data are identified during data screening, and screening
#results are communicated to the study site to have the problems corrected. Data screening
#can be based on common sense and/or criteria specified in the study.

#The table below describes the
#contents of each data set. Please generate screening reports, one for each site. The
#screening reports contain data you would like to verify with the study sites. Use common
#sense when you screen the data. For example, you would like to verify with the site if
#you see a subject from the site is taller than 100 inches. Your report should be easy to
#read for people who do not know SAS, e.g. an RN in doctorâ€™s office.
